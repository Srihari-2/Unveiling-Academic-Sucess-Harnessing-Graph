we delve into the utilization of graph machine learning techniques to forecast student
academic performance. By harnessing graph-based representations of educational data, our study
endeavors to unearth underlying patterns and connections that impact student success. Through a
fusion of feature engineering, graph analytics, and predictive modeling, we aim to investigate the efficacy
of graph-based methodologies in improving the precision and interpretability of student performance
prediction systems. This paper investigates the effectiveness of logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors
(KNN), and a custom Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for predicting student performance in exams.
Our analysis reveals that the custom GNN model outperforms both logistic regression and KNN,
achieving higher accuracy and efficiency in student performance prediction. The custom GNN model
leverages the graph-based representation of educational data, which enhances its ability to capture
complex relationships and dependencies among students.
